    <div class="item">
      <p> Hello , I'm Samriddhi Kala.I completed my schooling at St. Mary’s Convent Inter College in Prayagraj in 2023,
        focusing on Humanities and
        earning 91.75%. Since then, I have been pursuing two bachelor’s degrees: a BA in Economics at the University of
        Allahabad (2024–27) and a BBA in Digital Business and Entrepreneurship at IIM Bangalore (2024–27). Through these
        programs, I am deepening my understanding of economic theory and digital business practices. I have developed an
        interest in marketing strategies and financial analysis, and I enjoy applying quantitative and qualitative
        methods to assess business performance. I am gradually building my technical abilities in accounting,
        Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, statistical analysis, and website creation, and I look forward to refining
        these skills further.<br><br>

        I am passionate about blending analytical thinking with creative problem‑solving. Through my coursework and
        self‑driven projects, I have begun exploring how data‑driven insights can inform marketing campaigns and
        strategic decisions. I believe that clear communication—both in writing and via digital channels—is essential to
        conveying value. I approach new challenges with curiosity and a willingness to learn, and I aim to apply my
        growing knowledge in accounting, financial analysis, marketing, and web design to real‑world situations.
